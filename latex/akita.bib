	Abstract = {Recovering populations often must meet specific growth rate or abundance targets before their legal status can be changed from endangered or threatened. While the efficacy, power, and performance of population metrics to infer trends in declining populations has received considerable attention, how these same metrics perform when populations are increasing is less clear. We examined the ability of a one-sample effective population size (Ne) estimator (LDNe) to discriminate between stable and increasing population trends across varying sample and initial population sizes. The performance of LDNe was compared to the Lincoln-Peterson (LP) abundance (N) estimator. The ability to identify stable and increasing populations varied widely across sample sizes and number of generations between sequentially collected samples, but LDNe outperformed LP. One-sample Neestimates show promise as an efficient method of detecting population increase when samples of 60--120 individuals are collected 5--10 generations apart.},

@article{FRANKHAM201456,
	Abstract = {Conservation managers typically need to make prompt decisions based on limited information and resources. Consequently, generalisations have essential roles in guiding interventions. Here, we (i) critique information on some widely accepted generalisations and variables affecting them, (ii) assess how adequately genetic factors are currently incorporated into population viability analysis (PVA) models used to estimate minimum viable population sizes, and (iii) relate the above to population size thresholds of the IUCN Red List criteria for threatened species that were derived from genetic considerations. Evidence accumulated since 1980 shows that genetically effective population size (Ne)=50 is inadequate for preventing inbreeding depression over five generations in the wild, with Ne⩾100 being required to limit loss in total fitness to ⩽10%. Further, even Ne=500 is too low for retaining evolutionary potential for fitness in perpetuity; a better approximation is Ne⩾1000. Extrapolation from census population size (N) to Ne depends on knowing the ratio of Ne/N, yet this information is unavailable for most wild populations. Ratio averages (∼0.1--0.2) from meta-analyses are sufficient, provided adjustments are made for dissimilar life histories. Most PVA-based risk assessments ignore or inadequately model genetic factors. PVA should routinely include realistic inbreeding depression, and genetic impacts on evolutionary potential should be incorporated where appropriate. Genetic generalisations used in conservation, the treatment of genetics in PVAs, and sections of the IUCN Red List criteria derived from genetic considerations, all require revision to be more effective conservation tools.},

	Abstract = {Existing methods for estimating historical effective population size from genetic data have been unable to accurately estimate effective population size during the most recent past. We present a non-parametric method for accurately estimating recent effective population size by using inferred long segments of identity by descent (IBD). We found that inferred segments of IBD contain information about effective population size from around 4 generations to around 50 generations ago for SNP array data and to over 200 generations ago for sequence data. In human populations that we examined, the estimates of effective size were approximately one-third of the census size. We estimate the effective population size of European-ancestry individuals in the UK four generations ago to be eight million and the effective population size of Finland four generations ago to be 0.7 million. Our method is implemented in the open-source IBDNe software package.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Evaluating effective population size (Ne) and the effective size to census size ratio (Ne/N) in species with Type III survivorship curves is complicated when key demographic parameters [mean (\&\#x006b;̄) and variance (Vk) of family size] are measured during early life stages. The method of Crow \& Morton (1955) for scaling demographic data collected at a juvenile stage to expected values at adulthood is extended to consider sequential episodes of random and family correlated survival. Results show the following: (i) The order in which the episodes of random and family-correlated survival occur does not affect Ne or Ne/N; (ii) If a population experiences an episode of family-correlated survival, Ne/N scaled to its expected value in a population of constant size (\&\#x006b;̄ = 2) is simply the survival rate during the family-correlated stage. If multiple such stages occur, scaled Ne/N is the product of the survivals during all family-correlated life stages; (iii) Under the assumption of random post-enumeration survival, adjusting the variance effective size to its expected value at \&\#x006b;̄ = 2 is equivalent to computing the inbreeding effective size at the earlier life stage. Application to experimental data for hatchery populations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) indicates that nonrandom survival during the marine phase led to estimated reductions in effective size of 0--62\% (mean 19\%) in 12 different cohorts. This approach can provide insights into Ne/N in highly fecund species, including some marine species in which Ne has been estimated to be several orders of magnitude less than N.},

	Abstract = { Effective population size (Ne) controls both the rate of random genetic drift and the effectiveness of selection and migration, but it is difficult to estimate in nature. In particular, for species with overlapping generations, it is easier to estimate the effective number of breeders in one reproductive cycle (Nb) than Ne per generation. We empirically evaluated the relationship between life history and ratios of Ne, Nb and adult census size (N) using a recently developed model (agene) and published vital rates for 63 iteroparous animals and plants. Nb/Ne varied a surprising sixfold across species and, contrary to expectations, Nb was larger than Ne in over half the species. Up to two-thirds of the variance in Nb/Ne and up to half the variance in Ne/N was explained by just two life-history traits (age at maturity and adult lifespan) that have long interested both ecologists and evolutionary biologists. These results provide novel insights into, and demonstrate a close general linkage between, demographic and evolutionary processes across diverse taxa. For the first time, our results also make it possible to interpret rapidly accumulating estimates of Nb in the context of the rich body of evolutionary theory based on Ne per generation. },

	Abstract = {The important parameter of effective population size is rarely estimable directly from demographic data. Indirect estimates of effective population size may be made from genetic data such as temporal variation of allelic frequencies or linkage disequilibrium in cohorts. We suggest here that an indirect estimate of the effective number of breeders might be based on the excess of heterozygosity expected in a cohort of progeny produced by a limited number of males and females. In computer simulations, heterozygote excesses for 30 unlinked loci having various numbers of alleles and allele-frequency profiles were obtained for cohorts produced by samples of breeders drawn from an age-structured population and having known variance in reproductive success and effective number. The 95\% confidence limits around the estimate contained the true effective population size in 70 of 72 trials and the Spearman rank correlation of estimated and actual values was 0.991. An estimate based on heterozygote excess might have certain advantages over the previous estimates, requiring only single-locus and single-cohort data, but the sampling error among individuals and the effect of departures from random union of gametes still need-to be explored.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Molecular genetic data have found widespread application in the identification of population and conservation units for aquatic species. However, integration of genetic information into actual management has been slow, and explicit and quantitative inclusion of genetic data into fisheries models is rare. In part, this reflects the inherent difficulty in using genetic markers to draw inferences about demographic independence, which is generally the information of the greatest short-term interest to fishery managers. However, practical management constraints, institutional structures and communication issues have also contributed to the lack of integration. This paper identifies some of the organizational, conceptual and technical barriers that have hampered full use of genetics data in stock assessment and hence fishery management and outlines how such use could be enhanced.},

It has important applications in evolutionary biology, conservation genetics and plant and animal breeding, because it measures the rates of genetic drift and inbreeding and affects the efficacy of systematic evolutionary forces, such as mutation, selection and migration. We review the developments in predictive equations and estimation methodologies of effective size. In the prediction part, we focus on the equations for populations with different modes of reproduction, for populations under selection for unlinked or linked loci and for the specific applications to conservation genetics. In the estimation part, we focus on methods developed for estimating the current or recent effective size from molecular marker or sequence data. We discuss some underdeveloped areas in predicting and estimating Ne for future research.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a theory of a new statistic that tests overdispersion in offspring number on the basis of exactly known kinship relationships. The statistic utilizes the sample size and the number of kinship pairs found in a sample, specially the number of mother--offspring (MO) and maternal--half-sibling (MHS) pairs. Given a sufficiently large sample size, the statistic proposed in this paper approximately follows a standard-normal distribution under non-overdispersed conditions (Poisson's variance). We found that (1) the value of the statistic ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}ge 2{\$}{\$}≥2or {\$}{\$}<2{\$}{\$}<2) reasonably indicates whether reproduction is overdispersed at the 5{\%} significance level; (2) the power of the statistic is determined primarily by the balance between the degree of overdispersion and the sample size; (3) in many cases, if the number of kinship pairs can be approximated by a normal distribution, false-positive and false-negative situations can be avoided. The proposed method can detect moderate-weak levels of overdispersion that produce few MHS pairs in a sample because the effect of the population size (which determines the number of detected MHS pairs) is canceled by the detection of the number of MO pairs. Once the kinship determination procedure is established, this indirect measurement will be readily applicable to species even with weak overdispersion, expanding the available opportunities for understanding how overdispersion in offspring number affects ecological processes.},

	Abstract = {A new method is described for estimating genetic relatedness from genetic markers such as protein polymorphisms. It is based on Grafen's (1985) relatedness coefficient and is most easily interpreted in terms of identity by descent rather than as a genetic regression. It has several advantages over methods currently in use: it eliminates a downward bias for small sample sizes; it improves estimation of relatedness for subsets of population samples; and it allows estimation of relatedness for a single group or for a single pair of individuals. Individual estimates of relatedness tend to be highly variable but, in aggregate, can still be very useful as data for nonparametric tests. Such tests allow testing for differences in relatedness between two samples or for correlating individual relatedness values with another variable.},

@article{Creel:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Estimates of population size are critical for conservation and management, but accurate estimates are difficult to obtain for many species. Noninvasive genetic methods are increasingly used to estimate population size, particularly in elusive species such as large carnivores, which are difficult to count by most other methods. In most such studies, genotypes are treated simply as unique individual identifiers. Here, we develop a new estimator of population size based on pedigree reconstruction. The estimator accounts for individuals that were directly sampled, individuals that were not sampled but whose genotype could be inferred by pedigree reconstruction, and individuals that were not detected by either of these methods. Monte Carlo simulations show that the population estimate is unbiased and precise if sampling is of sufficient intensity and duration. Simulations also identified sampling conditions that can cause the method to overestimate or underestimate true population size; we present and discuss methods to correct these potential biases. The method detected 2-21% more individuals than were directly sampled across a broad range of simulated sampling schemes. Genotypes are more than unique identifiers, and the information about relationships in a set of genotypes can improve estimates of population size.},
